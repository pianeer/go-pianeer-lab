### gRPC + Protocol Buffers

While using Messaging Queues or REST/HTTP calls is a pretty standard mechanism for microservices to communicate internally, there are times when binary formats beat them in terms of performance and security. Plus, its fun to play with a new serialization mechanism.

Please make sure you have `protobuf` package and the `protoc` command available before hand for this program to work. Instructions on that can be found on the [ProtoBuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) GitHub Link
